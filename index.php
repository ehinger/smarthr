		<p class="introp">With over 25+ years’ work experience, in both Public and Private sectors, the work I’ve most enjoyed is when I work with individuals, team and organisations, to focus on the things that can make a real difference to workplace wellbeing and enjoyment. 
I believe that most people come to work and want to enjoy the experience. I also know and appreciate that sometimes things aren’t always plain sailing and people need help to work through an issue or concern. 
Sometimes independent assistance can help resolve workplace issues.  I am a trusted facilitator who helps people understand and resolve workplace issues. I frequently work with groups and individuals to help them achieve successful outcomes.
I know the key to achieving positive and pragmatic solutions is to create a forum that allows respectful, safe and structured conversations.

			<p class="wwdp">My approach is to explore the whole system to understand and explore cause and effect.
				As a coach I translate observations and work on helping to expand perspectives.
				I offer Individual and Team Coaching to improve Performance and Resolving Conflict.
				I believe that coaching offers real time learning, that is tailored to the development needs of individuals and teams.
				Ongoing coaching provides support for the change process to occur.
				Coaching conversations challenge and stretch for growth.<br><br></p></div>

					<p class="wwdp">I undertake independent workplace investigations for employers providing robust reliable findings and reports- without delay. 
						I believe we should use the right intervention, to gain maximum impact with minimal harm. To achieve this, we need to move away from adversarial to constructive dialogue and balance humanity with pragmatics
